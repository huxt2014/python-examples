                                declaration
 *   By declaring variables and functions, we furnish vital information that the
 * compiler will need in order to check a program for potential errors and
 * translate it into object code. In general, a declaration has the following
 * appearance:
       declaration-specifiers declarators;
 *   Declaration specifiers describe the properties of the variables or
 * functions being declared. These specifiers fall into four categories:
       1 Storage classes. There are four storage classes: auto,
         static, extern, and register. At most one storage class
         may appear in a declaration; if present, it should come
         first.
       2 Type qualifiers. In C89, there are only two type of
         qualifiers: const and volatile. C99 has a third type
         qualifier, restrict. A declaration may contain zero or
         more type qualifiers.
       3 Type specifiers. The keywords void, char, short, int,
         long, float, double, signed, and unsigned are all type
         specifiers. The order in which they appear doesn't
         matter. Type specifiers also include specifications
         of structures, unions, and enumerations.
       4 function specifier. Only in C99, used only in function
         declaration. This category has just one member, the
         keyword inline.
 *   Declarators include identifiers (names of simple variables), identifiers
 * followed by [] (array names), identifiers preceded by * (pointer names), and
 * identifiers followed by () (function names). Declarators are separated by
 * commas. A declarator that represents a variable may be followed by an
 * initializer.
 *   A variable can have many declarations in a program but should have only one
 * definition.

                           Properties of Variables
 *   Every variable in a C program has three properties:
       1 Storage duration. The storage duration of a variable
         determines when memory is set aside for the variable and
         when that memory is released. Storage for a variable with
         automatic storage duration is allocated when the
         surrounding block is executed, and is deallocated when
         the block terminates. A variable with static storage
         duration stays at the same storage location as long as
         the program is running.
       2 Scope. The scope of a variable is the portion of the
         program text in which the variable can be referenced. A
         variable can have either block scope (the variable is
         visible from its point of declaration to the end of the
         enclosing block) or file scope.
       3 Linkage. The linkage of a variable determines the extent
         to which it can be shared by different parts of a program.
         A variable with external linkage may be shared by several
         files in a program. A variable with internal linkage is
         restricted to a single file, but may be shared by the
         functions in that file. A variable with no linkage belongs
         to a single function and can't be shared at all.
 *   Variables declared inside a block (including a function body) have
 * automatic storage duration, block scope, and no linkage. Variables declared
 * outside any block, at the outermost level of a program, have static storage
 * duration, file scope and external linkage.
