Pandas enable Python to easily manipulate and perform powerful statistical and
mathematical analyses on tabular and multidimensional datasets.

The pandas library brings many of the good things from R, specifically the
DataFrame objects and R packages such as plyr and reshape2, and places them in a
single library that you can use in your Python applications.

Pandas is built on NumPy. It was initially designed with finance in mind,
specifically with its ability around time series data manipulation, but
emphasizes the data manipulation part of the equation leaving statistical,
financial, and other types of analyses to other Python libraries.

Pandas itself is not a data science toolkit. It does provide some statistical
methods as a matter of convenience, but to draw conclusions from data, it leans
upon other packages in the Python ecosystem, such as SciPy, NumPy, scikit-learn,
and upon graphics libraries such as matplotlib and ggvis for data visualization.
